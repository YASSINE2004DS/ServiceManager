 *
 * @function getUsers    : Async function to handle the request and response for getting all agencies.
 * @function createUser  : Async function to handle the request and response for creating a new agency.
 * @function getUserById : Async function to handle the request and response for getting a specific agency by ID.
 * @function modifyUser  : Async function to handle the request and response for updating an existing agency by ID.
 * @function deleteUser  : Async function to handle the request and response for deleting an agency by ID.
